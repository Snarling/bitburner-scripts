## box Element
The box Element is an Element with additional members added, listed below.
### box.head
A reference to the `Element` containing the head/titlebar of the box Element.
### box.body
A reference to the `Element` containing the body/content of the box Element.
### box.logDiv

### box.log(html, timestamp=true)
Adds a log entry to box.logDiv, with a timestamp (unless disabled). If box.logDiv is not defined, it is set to the first `.log` Element inside of box.body and if none is found then a new resizable log will be added and used.

Sample function overidding print and clear log to use box instead of tail window
```
const pinned = `Spending on '${toBuy}'. Will check in every ${ns.tFormat(interval)}. Reserving ${options['reserve-buffer']}`
boxTailSingleton(ns, 'hacknet', 'ðŸ–³', '100px', `<div>${pinned}</div>`);
function boxTailSingleton(ns, title, icon, height, pinned = "<div/>") {
	var res = [];
	sidebar.querySelectorAll('div.sbitem').forEach(sbitem => res.push({ sbitem, title: sbitem.querySelector('div.head > span').innerText }));
	let box = res.find(o => o.title === title);
	if (box) {
		box = box.sbitem;
	} else {
		box = createSidebarItem(title, pinned, icon);
	}
	if (height) box.style.height = height;

	const _clearLog = ns.clearLog;
	ns.clearLog = () => {
		_clearLog();
		box.logDiv = box.body.querySelector('div.log');
		if (box.logDiv) box.logDiv.replaceChildren([]);
	}
	const logEntryLimit = 500;
	const _print = ns.print;
	ns.print = (m) => {
		box.log(`<span>${m}</span>`);
		_print(m);
		box.logDiv = box.body.querySelector('div.log');
		while (box.logDiv.children.length > logEntryLimit) box.logDiv.children[0].remove();
	}
}
```


Parameter details:
* `html`: A String containing the HTML content of the log entry to be added.
* `timestamp`: A boolean representing whether to include a timestamp on the log entry. Defaults to true.
### box.toSide()
Converts the box Element into a sidebar item.
### box.toBox()
Converts the box Element into a draggable box.
### box.contextItems
An Object containing entries for context menu options, as well as conditional functions to determine whether to display each context option.

The following context options are provided by default:
* `"Remove Item"`: Removes the box Element.
* `"Cancel"`: Closing out of the context menu without doing anything. Can also be accomplished by clicking anywhere else on the screen.
* `"Move to Top"`: Moves the box Element to the top of the sidebar. Only shown for sidebar items.
* `"Move to Bottom"`: Moves the box Element to the bottom of the sidebar. Only shown for sidebar items.
* `"-> sidebar"`: Turns the box Element into a sidebar item. Only shown for draggable boxes.
* `"box <-"`: Turns the box Element into a draggable box. Only shown for sidebar items.

To delete a context item, for instance to disable a sidebarItem from being able to turn into a draggable box, use one of the following options:
```
box.contextItems["box <-"].cFn=()=>0 //Replace the context item's existing condition function with one that will always return false
delete box.contextItems["box <-"]; //Deletes the entire reference to the context item
```
### box.addContextItem(name, fn, cFn=()=>1)
Adds an option to box.contextItems, with a given function and conditional function. If not provided, the conditional defaults to always show the option.
